**Issue**: Describe the architectural design issue you’re addressing, leaving no questions about why you’re addressing this issue now. Following a minimalist approach, address and document only the issues that need addressing at various points in the life cycle.

**Decision**: Clearly state the architecture’s direction—that is, the position you’ve selected.

**Assumptions**: Clearly describe the underlying assumptions in the environment in which you’re making the decision—cost, schedule, technology, and so on. Note that environmental constraints (such as accepted technology standards, enterprise architecture, commonly employed patterns, and so on) might limit the alternatives you consider.

**Constraints**: Capture any additional constraints to the environment that the chosen alternative (the decision) might pose.
